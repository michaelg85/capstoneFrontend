CAPSTONE PROJECT - WHOSE MOVIE?! v2.0
FRONTEND

I decided to create this app to help my wife and I, along with countless couples, pick whose movie will be watched!

This version will also include the ability to keep a list of movies you would like to watch.

Currently the status of the build is in progress...

I will be pulling from the OMDBapi

This is a frontend React app

PROCESS:

create a frontend React app

installed: 
   axios
   react-router-dom

wrapped <App /> in <BrowserRouter> in main.jsx

created a GitHub repo and committed the project 

created a .env file 

added .env to a .gitignore file



my wife and I love each other very much but when it comes to choosing whose movie to watch it can become quite contentious!
input you list of up to ten movies and select which movies you'd like to enter into the ring, then let the app decide!
if you let the app choose, you must watch it all the way through so "enter" with caution!
another option is to let each other choose a predetermined ammount of movies from your partners list and then let the app decide!






# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
