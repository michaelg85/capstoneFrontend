CAPSTONE PROJECT - WHOSE MOVIE?! v2.0
FRONTEND

I decided to create this app to help my wife and I, along with countless couples, pick whose movie will be watched!

This version will also include the ability to keep a list of movies you would like to watch.

Currently the status of the build is in progress...

I will be pulling from the OMDBapi

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
